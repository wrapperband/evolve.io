# evolve.io
evolution simulator written by Carykh  AKA Cary Huang


From Youtube Evolv.io is now open source! (And I might stop developing Evolv.io)

The initial commit is the original files, the second is the refined files.

Hi people! I just hit 50,000 subscribers after recording this video, so I didn't have a chance to say thank you in the video. Why not say it here? THANKS FOR 50K

WARNING: The source files below don't have the best style. That's what happens when you try to rush together a project in 3 days without the intent of sharing it with others! It's definitely better than the original though.

ULTRA WARNING: It looks like it only works in Processing 2. So sorry for not mentioning that in the video. (However, if you just copy the raw text of the files into Processing 3, I think it should work...)

SUPER WARNING: You have to move all the .pde files and the data folder INTO a folder called "evolvioColor" for it to work correctly. Then, run Processing 2, select "Open", and double click on any of the .pde files.

HYPER WARNING: The first source files linked create very small creatures, which means more of them can exist, meaning MUCH MORE LAG (when running 1x). If you don't want lag, go with the second link, which has the source files from the last Evolv.io video. (But these older files don't have tile optimization, so they'll lag when you have play speed set really high)
